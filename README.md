## Directory to Tree

The **Directory to Tree** project is a Node.js application designed to programmatically traverse a directory tree and generate a hierarchical object representation of a directory and its subdirectories up to a specified depth. 
This representation is particularly useful for manipulating data in memory, transmitting it over a network, or displaying it in a web application or terminal interface.

## Features

- **Traversal of Directory Tree:** Walks through a specified directory and its subdirectories.
- **Object Structure:** Produces a tree-like object that contains information about files and directories, including their names, paths, types, sizes, and children.
- **Depth Limitation:** Allows specification of the depth of traversal, enabling efficient exploration of large directory structures.

## Log Events
This project implements a logging system using Node.js that captures events with timestamps and unique identifiers. The system leverages the `uuid` package for generating unique IDs and the `date-fns` package for formatting dates. The logs are stored in a text file, with the necessary directories created programmatically.

## Overview
The logging system consists of two main files:

- **LogEvents.js**: Contains the `LogEvents` function that handles logging events to a file.
- **index.js**: Sets up an `EventEmitter` to emit log events and invoke the logging function.

## CRUD Application

This project implements a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Node.js and TypeScript. The application allows users to manage data efficiently by performing standard database operations, and it is structured to demonstrate the usage of RESTful API principles.

## Overview
The CRUD application allows users to:

- **Create** new records: used to add new items
